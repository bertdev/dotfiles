# Neovim

In my neovim configuration I'll try to be minimalist. I like so much neovim built ins, so will be added only a few things that I like to have on my development flow.

Features:
- Package management (done - lazy nvim)
- Lsp
- syntax highlighting (done - tree-sitter)
- Git
- Fuzzy finder (done - telescope)
- File tree (done - neo tree)
- Bar line
- Hot key files jump

Languages that i use:
- Typescript/Javascript
- Go
- Rust
- C++
- Lua
- Bash
- Html/css
- Yaml/Json/Markdown
